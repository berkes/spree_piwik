Installation
------------

Add spree_piwik to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_piwik'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_piwik:install
```

Add your Piwik URL and site-id to the `config/initializers/spree_piwik.rb`

For example:
```ruby
Spree::Piwik::Config[:piwik_url] = "piwik.example.com"
Spree::Piwik::Config[:piwik_id] =  1337

```
Will use http(s)://piwik.example.com/ as url for your Piwik. And track
stats for the site that has the id 1337 in Piwik.


Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:
